# Popular Fact

> Soy contains estrogen and is akin to hormone replacement therapy

or
 
> Soy contains *phytoestrogens* which are completely different and have no effect on humans

# Reality 

> Soy contains phytoestrogens which may interact with the human body in a variety of ways (including hormonally).

See below for a more detailed explanation.  
See our article on [Soy is bad for you?]({{<ref "/facts/soy-is-bad-for-you">}}) for more on what this means.  

## What are phytoestrogens and isoflavones?
> Phytoestrogens are naturally-occurring plant compounds that are structurally and/or functionally similar to mammalian estrogens and their active metabolites.

### What Isoflavones does soy contain?
> Soy contains the isoflavones:  
> - Biochanin A   
> - Clycitein   
> - Daidzein  
> - Formononetin  
> - Genistein

## How do isoflavones interact with the body?
> Some isoflavones, most notably genistein, inhibit pathways important for cell growth and proliferation, an effect which affects multiple organ systems.

and

> Phytoestrogens are plant‐derived dietary compounds with structural similarity to 17‐β‐oestradiol (E2), the primary female sex hormone. This structural similarity to E2 enables phytoestrogens to cause (anti)oestrogenic effects by binding to the oestrogen receptors.

and

> Isoflavones are often termed as phytoestrogens as they have a chemical structure similar to the human hormone oestrogen. However, it is now well established that in the human body, isoflavones do not behave like the human hormone oestrogen: they are weaker, they only have effects on some body tissues and in some situations they can have opposite effect to oestrogen.

From these sources we can conclude that soy's phytoestrogens can have an effect on the human body, *what* exactly that effect may be is covered in more detail in [Soy is bad for you?]({{<ref "/facts/soy-is-bad-for-you">}}).
