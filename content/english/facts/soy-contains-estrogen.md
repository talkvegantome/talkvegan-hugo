# Popular Fact

> Soy contains estrogen and is akin to hormone replacement therapy

or
 
> Soy contains *phytoestrogens* which are completely different and have no effect on humans

# Reality 

> Soy contains phytoestrogens which may interact with the human body in a variety of ways (including hormonally).

See below for a more detailed explanation.  
See our article on [Soy is bad for you?]({{<ref "/facts/soy-is-bad-for-you">}}) for more on what this means.  

## What are phytoestrogens and isoflavones?
> Phytoestrogens are naturally-occurring plant compounds that are structurally and/or functionally similar to mammalian estrogens and their active metabolites.

### What Isoflavones does soy contain?
> Soy contains the isoflavones:  
> - Biochanin A   
> - Clycitein   
> - Daidzein  
> - Formononetin  
> - Genistein

## How do isoflavones interact with the body?
> Some isoflavones, most notably genistein, inhibit pathways important for cell growth and proliferation, an effect which affects multiple organ systems.

In other words, it's possible for human cell growth to be increased by phytoestrogens. This might be of concern in the case of, e.g. breast cancer.

> Phytoestrogens are plant‐derived dietary compounds with structural similarity to 17‐β‐oestradiol (E2), the primary female sex hormone. This structural similarity to E2 enables phytoestrogens to cause (anti)oestrogenic effects by binding to the oestrogen receptors.  
> [...]  
> [P]hytoestrogens are also considered endocrine disruptors, indicating that they have the potential to cause adverse health effects such as infertility and increased risks of cancer in oestrogen-sensitive organs.

Phytoestrogens have a similar shape to human estorogen, which enables them to interrupt the normal absorption of human estrogen in the endocrine (hormonal) system.

> Phytoestrogens produce estrogenic, anti-estrogenic or no activity depending upon the tissue. [Oestrogen Receptor Alpha] and [Oestrogen Receptor Beta] display distinct expression patterns in male and female[s...].

Phytoestrogens effects vary from one body part to another and from one sex expression to another. They are 

From these sources we can conclude that soy's phytoestrogens can have an effect on the human body, *what* exactly that effect may be is covered in more detail in [Soy is bad for you?]({{<ref "/facts/soy-is-bad-for-you">}}).
