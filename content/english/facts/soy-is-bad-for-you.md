# Popular Fact

> Soy's phytoestrogens cause a variety of negative health effects including reducing male fertility.

See our article: [Soy contains estrogen]({{<ref "/facts/soy-contains-estrogen">}}) for more information on phytoestrogens.

# Reality

> 1. Soy contains phytoestrogens which are structurally similar to human estrogen (specifically *isoflavones*) which can have hormonal effects on the body.
> 2. The maximum safe dosages are not well understood. 
> 3. It is _unlikely_ that you will ingest a high enough dosage to affect your health as part of a balanced diet provided you do not have any special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.). But you should ensure that you vary your protein sources and consult your dietitian for special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.) see *Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018* below.  
> 4. All articles on the topic caveat their conclusions with: 'more research is needed'.  
>  
> \- TalkVeganToMe's layman's understanding from surveying the material available online

Because of the complexity of this topic (and lack of definitive declarations of safety from major organisations and articles not associated with the soy industry) we have summarised our findings in a heavily caveated fashion in order to accurately reflect the research we found.


## 1. Soy Contains Phytoestrogens

This was our biggest surprise in researching this topic, as we had heard over and over again that soy contained _plant_ estrogen, you don't need to worry about plant estrogen, that's silly!

Unfortunately phytoestrogens are not so easily dismissed.

See *[Soy contains estrogen]({{<ref "/facts/soy-contains-estrogen">}})* for more.

## 2. The Dosage Levels are Not Well understood

This assertion is based on:

1. How much phytoestrogen is in food is difficult to measure and varies wildly
2. How much is safe to eat is not well understood


### 2.1 Hard to tell how much phytoestrogen is in food
> In Canada, isoflavones [a type of phytoestrogen] in soy beans vary from 360 to 2241 mg per kg [119]. Isoflavones content in soy beans from Romania ranged between 210 and 1340 g per kg [120], 1176–3309 mg per kg in USA [121] and 525–986 mg per kg in India [122].

~

> In another British study of women from the Oxford-EPIC cohort, including vegetarian and vegan subgroups, it has been reported an intake up to 30 g per day of soy protein and 130 mg per day of isoflavones, with most of the highest soy intake in vegetarians or vegans

### 2.2 How much is safe to eat is not well understood.

> There are also real concerns that excessive amounts of isoflavones in serum may promote other hormone-related problems.

> [P]hytoestrogens are also considered endocrine disruptors, indicating that they have the potential to cause adverse health effects such as infertility and increased risks of cancer in oestrogen-sensitive organs.  
> [...]  
>  These adverse effects have been mainly suggested based on data from in vitro, animal or epidemiological studies. Clinical studies often report the absence of adverse effects. 
> - [The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology - 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20190922065924/https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bph.13622)

> Concerns about the adverse effect of soy consumption were originally based on animal data.  
> - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)

~

> At the same time, to have the beneficial effects of soy isoflavones, intake should be at least of 60-100 mg per day, at present not easily reached in Western countries.  
> - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p21](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)

## 3. It's unlikely you'll ingest enough to have adverse effects, but vary your protein intake anyway!

> Overall, the low content of bioactive compounds in second generation soy foods [(e.g. soy based mock meats)] and moderate amounts in traditional soy preparations offer modest health benefits with very limited risk for potential adverse health effects.  
> - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p21](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)

An interesting datapoint was the stipulation in the same metanalysis that:

> [T]o have the beneficial effects of soy isoflavones, intake should be at least of 60-100 mg per day, at present not easily reached in Western countries.  
> - [Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - Nutrients - 2018 - p21](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002195620/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5793271/pdf/nutrients-10-00043.pdf/)


Having a varied diet is rarely bad advice. And while you're unlikely to eat enough to adversely affect your health, it's also pretty much impossible to measure how much phytoestrogen you're ingesting on a daily basis without specialised equipment. And even if you could, there are no official recommended daily allowances to stay below.

> The use of various protein sources could be useful for avoiding a monochromatic nutrition in vegetarians, widely based on soy. Key nutrients in soy (such as proteins, minerals, vitamins and phytochemicals) are also shared by others plant foods, so it is unnecessary in vegetarian diet to always choose soy and soy foods. Seeds, nuts, cereals and other pulses can be good sources of protein that can be alternatively chosen to obtain a nutritionally adequate and healthy diet, as proposed in VegPlate method and the use of soy can be limited to personal taste and habits.

## 4. More research is needed
This was repeated by _every single study_ we read.

> Despite the high intakes in Asian countries, there is still a paucity of long term data on soy consumption in Western countries. Currently, the use of soy foods in infancy, including soy-based infant formulas, was not linked to adverse events. However, absence of evidence is not an evidence of absence. With the growing adoption of vegetarian diets and with the choice of soy formulas by Western vegetarian parents, a broader characterization of the role of soy foods in Western nutrition could help the acceptance of plant-based new generation foods.

and

> Having said that more rigorous studies are required to assess dose-response relationships while consuming soy food and supplementation.

and

> Given the rapid increase in global consumption of phytoestrogens and the fact that phytoestrogens are present in a wide range of dietary food supplements and widely marketed as a natural alternative to oestrogen replacement therapy, further insight into the risks and benefits of these phytoestrogens seems essential.

# Article Summaries

In order to provide some general sources that indicate risk/indicate a lack of risk, we have summarised the main topics of discussion with some relevant articles in the following sections

- [Soy in Infant Formula]({{<ref "/facts/effects-of-soy/soy-infant-formula">}}) 
- [Soy & Cancer]({{<ref "/facts/effects-of-soy/soy-cancer">}}) 
- [Soy & Male Fertility]({{<ref "/facts/effects-of-soy/soy-male-fertility">}}) 
- [Soy Overall]({{<ref "/facts/effects-of-soy/soy-overall">}})



#### Vegan Society & British Association of Dietitians

> Evidence suggests that soya is not a threat to our health and is in fact a reliable and healthy protein source.  
> - [Vegan Society - General FAQs](https://web.archive.org/web/20191002203547/https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/general-faqs)

TalkVeganToMe reached out to The Vegan Society to enquire after the sources for the evidence. The Vegan Society replied incredibly promptly and directed us to the The British Association of Dietitian's as their source.

> There is now scientific agreement that the controversy around isoflavones’ potential to have bad side effects in humans is fuelled only by findings from laboratory or animal studies using pure isoflavones or high doses. It is well established that animals metabolise isoflavones in a different and much more efficient way to humans and results from such studies cannot be compared to any human outcomes. Additionally, using high doses of pure isoflavones cannot be compared to consuming isoflavones from whole soya foods as they provide lower quantities and are a combination of many biologically active molecules. Comprehensive reviews by the European Food Safety Authority, World Cancer Research Fund and the World Health Organisation all conclude that soya foods as part of a healthy balanced diet are safe.
