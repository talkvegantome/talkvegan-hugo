# Soy & Male Fertility

This article is purely a summary of the articles which rally evidence for negative and positive impacts of soy on male fertility.
TalkVeganToMe's position on soy's dietary impact can be found in *[Soy is bad for you?]({{<ref "/facts/soy-is-bad-for-you">}})* and can be summarised as:

> 1. Soy contains phytoestrogens which are structurally similar to human estrogen (specifically *isoflavones*) which may or may not have negative effects in high dosages (see *[Soy contains estrogen]({{<ref "/facts/soy-contains-estrogen">}})*).  
> 2. It is _unlikely_ that you will ingest a high enough dosage to affect your health as part of a balanced diet provided you do not have any special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.) 
> 3. All articles on the topic caveat their conclusions with: 'more research is needed'.  
> 4. Ensure that you vary your protein sources and consult your dietitian for special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.) see *Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018* below.

# Articles indicating risk

## Hypogonadism and erectile dysfunction associated with soy product consumption - 2011
> We present the case of a 19-y-old type 1 diabetic but otherwise healthy man with sudden onset of loss of libido and erectile dysfunction after the ingestion of large quantities of soy-based products in a vegan-style diet. Blood levels of free and total testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) were taken at the initial presentation for examination and continuously monitored up to 2 y after discontinuation of the vegan diet. Blood concentrations of free and total testosterone were initially decreased, whereas DHEA was increased. These parameters normalized within 1 y after cessation of the vegan diet.

**Note:** This is a study of a single person which has not been replicated in any other study we have seen.

## An unusual case of gynecomastia associated with soy product consumption - 2008
>  A 60-year-old man was referred to the endocrinology clinic [...]. He reported erectile dysfunction and decreased libido.[...] Because of the normal findings from the imaging evaluation, the patient was interviewed again, and he described a daily intake of 3 quarts [3.4 litres] of soy milk. After he discontinued drinking soy milk, his breast tenderness resolved and his estradiol concentration slowly returned to normal.

# Articles indicating a lack of risk/a lack of data

## Soy protein isolates of varying isoflavone content do not adversely affect semen quality in healthy young men - 2010
> In summary, this study demonstrated that 8 weeks' consumption of SPI of low or high isoflavone content did not significantly affect semen quality parameters in a sample of 32 healthy adult males. Future studies should be of longer duration to better account for the time required for spermatogenesis and thus more accurately reflect the effect of soy isoflavones on semen quality and reproductive health in adult men.
