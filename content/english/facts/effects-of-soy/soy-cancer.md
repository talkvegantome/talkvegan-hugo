# Soy & Cancer

This article is purely a summary of the articles which rally evidence for negative and positive impacts of soy on cancer.
TalkVeganToMe's position on soy's dietary impact can be found in *[Soy is bad for you?]({{<ref "/facts/soy-is-bad-for-you">}})* and can be summarised as:

> 1. Soy contains phytoestrogens which are structurally similar to human estrogen (specifically *isoflavones*) which may or may not have negative effects in high dosages (see *[Soy contains estrogen]({{<ref "/facts/soy-contains-estrogen">}})*).  
> 2. It is _unlikely_ that you will ingest a high enough dosage to affect your health as part of a balanced diet provided you do not have any special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.) 
> 3. All articles on the topic caveat their conclusions with: 'more research is needed'.  
> 4. Ensure that you vary your protein sources and consult your dietitian for special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.) see *Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018* below.

# Articles indicating risk

# Dietary Soy and Increased Risk of Bladder Cancer - 2002
> The association between soyfood consumption and subsequent bladdercancer risk was investigated in a population-based cohort study, the Singapore Chinese Health Study. As of December 31, 2000, 329,848 person-years of follow-up were accrued. Sixty-one histologically confirmed incident bladder cancer cases were identified. Information on soyfood consumption at baseline was obtained through in-person interviews using a validated dietary questionnaire. [...]  
> High intake of soyfood was statistically significantly related to an elevated risk of bladder cancer.

## Effects of soy-protein supplementation on epithelial proliferation in the histologically normal human breast - 1998
> Short-term dietary soy stimulates breast proliferation; further studies are required to determine whether this is due to estrogen agonist activity and to examine the long-term effects of soy supplementation on the pituitary gland and breast.

## Stimulatory Influence of Soy Protein Isolate on Breast Secretion in Pre- and Postmenopausal Women - 1996

> Instead, this pilot study indicates that prolonged consumption of soy protein isolate has a stimulatory effect on the premenopausal female breast, characterized by increased secretion of breast fluid, the appearance of hyperplastic epithelial cells, and elevated levels of plasma estradiol. These findings are suggestive of an estrogenic stimulus from the isoflavones genistein and daidzein contained in soy protein isolate.

# Articles indicating a lack of risk/a lack of data

## Breast Cancer
> The available human studies do not indicate that an isoflavone exposure as reported in the thoroughly studied Asian population or as investigated in clinical studies (i.e., about 100 mg/day) negatively influences breast cancer risk or the thyroid hormone system in healthy women. However, the SKLM points out that particular attention should be given to the susceptible risk groups. These include people with an iodine deficiency4 (especially during pregnancy), (subclinical) hypothyroidism, and/or (congenital) thyroid dysfunction as well as women with breast cancer or with a history of breast cancer.  
> [...]  
> There is a need for further scientific research to be able to perform a conclusive risk assessment on the impact of isoflavones on breast tissue and the thyroid hormone system.
