#### Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018

This meta-analysis became one of our primary sources due to its recency and broad coverage of other articles.

##### On Adverse Effect Concerns

> Concerns about the adverse effect of soy consumption were originally based on animal data [240,241,242]. Today we are aware of the difficulty of extrapolating data from in vivo study to human utility in daily application [243]. In murine models, for example, in utero exposition of estradiol were not comparable to humans due to picomolar versus micromolar concentrations, respectively [244]. Monkey differs from human in isoflavone metabolism, with a more efficiency in daidzein to equol conversion [245]. Non-human primates and rodents have a profoundly different isoflavone metabolism.

> The debate on the potential perturbation on sex hormones network by phytoestrogens specially pertains infants fed soy-based formula [81] and the putative consequences of massive introduction early in life [278,279]. 

~ 
>  Moreover, dietary soy intake has been associated with increased risk of thyroid disorders [280], bladder cancer incidence [281], dementia [282] and breast cell proliferation [283,284]. Soy use during pregnancy was shown to alter the epigenome in offspring and can have health implications of in utero stimuli [285].

~
> Little perturbation on reproductive health have been reported, including feminizing effects, erectile dysfunction and reduced libido linked to very large intakes of isoflavones, even though available data revealed only minor detrimental effects or no impact on health [418,419]. However, no oestrogen perturbations were reported in clinical studies with high exposures to isoflavones in men [420]. In a cross-sectional study, soy foods intake was inversely linked to sperm concentration in 99 men despite no changes in quality parameters and the cohort was enrolled from sub fertile couples group with no detailed information on soy intakes [421]. Conversely, sperm count and motility were positively related to isoflavone intake [422] or with no correlation between isoflavone intake and sexual hormones or semen quality [423]. Testosterone levels were evaluated in a meta-analysis of 32 reports with no conclusive interaction between soy or isoflavone intake and free testosterone concentrations [424]. The majority of information about soy to sex hormones interaction came from in vitro and in vivo studies [379,425].

##### On extrapolation from data
> Despite the high intakes in Asian countries, there is still a paucity of long term data on soy consumption in Western countries. Currently, the use of soy foods in infancy, including soy-based infant formulas, was not linked to adverse events. However, absence of evidence is not an evidence of absence.

##### On methodology
> The transfer of data from in vitro and animal model to human health, as well as clinical trial results with isolate or concentrate fractions from soy, as well diverse nutraceuticals supplements, must be carefully interpreted. The disturbing effect of soy on thyroid hormones in subclinical hypothyroidism has been debated but it seems to be a mere goitrogenic [(interfering with iodine absorption)] mechanism, so it is crucial to satisfy adequate intakes of iodine from foods or by fortification, especially in vegetarians.

##### Conclusion and recommendation
> The use of various protein sources could be useful for avoiding a monochromatic nutrition in vegetarians, widely based on soy. Key nutrients in soy (such as proteins, minerals, vitamins and phytochemicals) are also shared by others plant foods, so it is unnecessary in vegetarian diet to always choose soy and soy foods. Seeds, nuts, cereals and other pulses can be good sources of protein that can be alternatively chosen to obtain a nutritionally adequate and healthy diet, as proposed in VegPlate method and the use of soy can be limited to personal taste and habits.

#### The potential health effects of dietary phytoestrogens - British Journal of Pharmacology - 2017

> Tempfer et al. (2009) reported a meta‐analysis on possible side effects of phytoestrogens. Based on 174 randomized controlled trials, it was concluded that phytoestrogen supplements have a safe side effect profile with moderately elevated rates of gastrointestinal side effects. It is important to note, however, that these studies were generally not designed to study the safety of the phytoestrogens.

> [I]t can be concluded that several potential health benefits of phytoestrogens have been reported but that, given the data on potential adverse health effects, the current evidence on these beneficial health effects is not so obvious that they clearly outweigh the possible health risks. This implies that a definite conclusion on possible beneficial health effects of phytoestrogens cannot be made.

This study does not put a specific weight to the risks in question, focussing more heavily as it does on the research into the potential benefits. It simply acknowledges that because "the health benefits or risks of isoflavones and other phytoestrogens are still controversial" making recommendations to consume additional soy products on the basis of the supposed benefits is not warranted.

#### Pros and cons of phytoestrogens - Front Neuroendocrinol - 2010

> Consumers should be aware that soy contains endocrine disrupting compounds and make dietary choices accordingly. For a typical consumer, alarm over soy products is likely unnecessary but so is the belief that a soy-rich diet will alleviate all ills. Women who are pregnant, nursing, or attempting to become pregnant should use soy foods with caution and be aware that soy formula may not be the best option for their babies. Older individuals, especially those with high cholesterol, may experience modest benefits including improved bone and cardiovascular health, and perhaps a decreased risk of carcinogenesis.

#### Effect of soy on health outcomes - Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality - 2005

>  The evidence from human studies does not suggest any worrisome adverse events beyond mild gastrointestinal intolerance. Conclusions were often limited due to small numbers of studies or heterogeneity across studies. Given the large amount of heterogeneity and inadequate reporting, particularly related to soy protein and isoflavone dose, many questions remain as to whether specific soy products in adequate doses may be of benefit in specific populations. Further, well-conducted studies are needed to clarify the effect of soy dose on lipid parameters and to determine whether soy components other than protein or isoflavones may be responsible for the lipid effects seen.
