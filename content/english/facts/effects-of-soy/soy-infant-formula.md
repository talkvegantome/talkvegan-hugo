# Soy & Infant Formula
This article is purely a summary of the articles which rally evidence for negative and positive impacts of soy in infant formula.
TalkVeganToMe's position on soy's dietary impact can be found in *[Soy is bad for you?]({{<ref "/facts/soy-is-bad-for-you">}})* and can be summarised as:

> 1. Soy contains phytoestrogens which are structurally similar to human estrogen (specifically *isoflavones*) which may or may not have negative effects in high dosages (see *[Soy contains estrogen]({{<ref "/facts/soy-contains-estrogen">}})*).  
> 2. It is _unlikely_ that you will ingest a high enough dosage to affect your health as part of a balanced diet provided you do not have any special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.) 
> 3. All articles on the topic caveat their conclusions with: 'more research is needed'.  
> 4. Ensure that you vary your protein sources and consult your dietitian for special circumstances (e.g. hypothyroidism, infancy, etc.) see *Soy, Soy Foods and Their Role in Vegetarian Diets - 2018* below.

## The health implications of soy infant formula - 2009
>  [A]lthough [Soy Formula] differed significantly from [Breast Milk], [Milk Forumla] also differed from [Breast Milk], and [Soy Formula] differed from [Milk Forumla]. Nonetheless, these animals grew and developed normally, and [Soy Formula] piglets had several health benefits (eg, increased bone quality) and no observable adverse effects. Thus, to date, our results suggest that [Soy Formula] supports normal growth and may have advantages in promoting bone development.

**Note:** This is a study of the effect of soy infant formula on pigs, not on humans.

# Articles indicating a lack of risk/a lack of data

## US National Toxicology Program Monograph on Soy Infant Formula - 2010
> The NTP concurs with the conclusion of the CERHR Expert Panel on Soy Infant Formula that
there is minimal concern for adverse effects on development in infants who consume soy
infant formula.
> This level of concern represents a “2” on the five-level scale of concern used by the NTP.
> [...] The existing epidemiological literature on soy infant formula exposure is insufficient to reach a conclusion on whether soy infant formula does or does not cause adverse effects on development in humans. There is “clear evidence” for adverse effects of genistein [(the primary isoflavone in soy infant formula)] on reproductive development and function in female rats and mice manifested as accelerated puberty [...], abnormal estrous cyclicity, cellular changes to the female reproductive tract, and decreased fecundity (i.e., decreased fertility, implants, and litter size). Also, Infants fed soy infant formula can have blood levels of total genistein that exceed those measured in neonatal or weanling rodents following treatment with genistein at dose levels that induced adverse effects in the animals.  
> However, the NTP accepts the conclusions of the expert panel that the current literature in laboratory animals is limited in its utility for reaching conclusions for infants fed soy infant formula. The NTP agrees with the expert panel that the individual isoflavone studies [...] in laboratory animals would benefit from data on the effects of mixtures of isoflavones and/or other components present in soy infant formula because these mixture studies would better replicate human infant exposures.

## Exposure to Soy-Based Formula in Infancy and Endocrinological and Reproductive Outcomes in Young Adulthood - 2001
> No statistically significant differences were observed between groups in either women or men for more than 30 outcomes. However, women who had been fed soy formula reported slightly longer duration of menstrual bleeding [...], with no difference in severity of menstrual flow. They also reported greater discomfort with menstruation (unadjusted relative risk for extreme discomfort vs no or mild pain[...]).
