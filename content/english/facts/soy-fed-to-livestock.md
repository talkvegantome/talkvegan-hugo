# Popular Fact
> 75% of soybeans grown worldwide are fed to livestock

This statistic is variously quoted as anything from 70% to 90%.

# Reality

The most recent statistics from the [USDA's World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates - May 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190618093258/https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/3t945q76s/7s75dn66b/f1881w33j/wasde0519.pdf) show **77%** of global soybean production is used for animal feed. (See the section on the USDA below for more information.)

Yale links to a [Greenpeace Article](http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/research/eating-up-the-amazon/).
Which in turn cites 'Worldwatch Institute (2006)', which appears to refer to [State of the World 2006 - Worldwatch Institute](https://archive.org/details/stateofworld200600nier)

This in turn cites 'Mark Ash, Economic Research Service, USDA, e-mail to author, May 2005'.  

## USDA World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates

I reached out to Mr Ash from the USDA Economic Research Service myself and ze replied (_incredibly_ quickly) saying that ze would most likely have used the [USDA’s Production, Supply and Distribution database](https://apps.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/app/index.html#/app/advQuery) or the [Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report](https://www.usda.gov/oce/commodity/wasde/index.htm) as sources for this statistic and that furthermore:  

>  If the question really is how much soybean meal is consumed for feed from the processing of soybeans, then the percentage is closer to 77 percent.

In order to calculate the figure, you take the world total use for soybean meal (232.74 million metric tons) [WASDE May 2019 - p29](https://web.archive.org/web/20190618093258/https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/3t945q76s/7s75dn66b/f1881w33j/wasde0519.pdf) and divide it by the world domestic crush for soybeans (301.63 million metric tons) [WASDE May 2019- p28](https://web.archive.org/web/20190618093258/https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/3t945q76s/7s75dn66b/f1881w33j/wasde0519.pdf) which gives you 77%.  
According to Mr Ash, nearly all of the domestic use of soybean meal is for animal feed and this is backed up by this archived summary article from SoyaTech, which, while unsourced itself, is from independent technical resource in the soy industry..

> About 85 percent of the world’s soybeans are processed, or "crushed," annually into soybean meal and oil.  Approximately 98 percent of the soybean meal that is crushed is further processed into animal feed with the balance used to make soy flour and proteins.  
> - [SoyaTech 2017](https://web.archive.org/web/20170112075924/http://www.soyatech.com/soy_facts.htm)

Here we are comparing statistics about global **soybean** production vs global **soybean meal** consumption. The amount of meal consumed by ton is 77% of the total soybean production globally. Assuming that only trace amounts of soybean meal is used for anything other than animal feed (as suggested by Mr Ash, an expert in the field), we can rest our figure for animal feed consumption at 77% of total global soybean production.
