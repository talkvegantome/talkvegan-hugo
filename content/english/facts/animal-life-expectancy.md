# Popular fact

> Animals live a life worth living prior to being slaughter

# Reality

Animals live for as little as 1.6% of their natural lifespan (7 weeks vs 12 years for broiler (meat) chickens). And even dairy cows get only of 20% of their 20 year lifespan.

Regardless of whether you regard 20% of a life as "good enough", unnecessary death is indefensible ethically, regardless of length or quality of life.

See below for sources.
