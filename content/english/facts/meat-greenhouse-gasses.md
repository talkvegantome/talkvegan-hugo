# Popular Fact

> Livestock and their byproducts account for at least 32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.  
> - [Cowspiracy - 2010](https://www.cowspiracy.com/facts)

This in turn cites the following articles (see below for more information):
 - Goodland and Anhang, WorldWatch 2009
 - An [article from The Independent](https://web.archive.org/web/20191007065803/https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/study-claims-meat-creates-half-of-all-greenhouse-gases-1812909.html) talking about Goodland and Anhang's article
 - [A Leading Cause of Everything: One Industry That Is Destroying Our Planet and Our Ability to Thrive on It - 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20190806054506/https://harvardelr.com/2015/10/26/elrs-a-leading-cause-of-everything-one-industry-that-is-destroying-our-planet-and-our-ability-to-thrive-on-it/) which ultimately cites the Goodland and Anhang article.

# Reality


## WorldWatch - What if the key actors in climate change are… cows, pigs, and chickens? - 2009

> But our analysis shows that livestock and their byproducts actually account for at least 32,564 million tons of CO2e per year, or 51 percent of annual worldwide GHG emissions.

## Repsonse

>  The Goodland/Anhang analysis was peer-reviewed. In order for employees of the World Bank to do any press or have articles published they must have it cleared by the World Bank first. Goodland and Anhang used the global standard for measuring GHGs http://www.ghgprotocol.org/city-accounting, something that the FAO report did not even do.
