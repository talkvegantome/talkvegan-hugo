## Household items

Everything from household cleaners to pillows may be tested on animals or contain animal products, as always it's important to read the ingredients and look for cruelty free labels.  


### Gotchas

- Pillows usually contain feathers (obvious, but easily forgotten!)
- Glue (often contain Isinglass)
- Vitamins (A, B12, and D3 are often non-vegan)
- Medicines generally

## Medicines

> Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose.

If you are stocking up on everyday items like condoms, or over-the-counter painkillers it's easy enough to check out a list of [vegan medicines](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/medications/list-animal-free-medications) and make sure the product you're buying is vegan.  
If you take medications to treat chronic or acute conditions you can ask your doctor if there are vegan alternatives to your regular medications.  
**BUT** it is vital that you do not abstain from critical medications if vegan alternatives are unavailable. Veganism is about what is possible and practicable, sacrificing your health to avoid animal products does not help anyone and if anything is more likely to make you stop going vegan altogether.
