# Toiletries

With all items, but particularly makeup, some research is required to determine whether animal testing was involved in the research and development stages of the product.

## Gotchas

- Bar soap is usually made with animal fat (Tallow, Sodium Tallowate, Glycerin)
- 'Cruelty free' does not mean it is free from animal products
- Condoms (often contain Casein) [Vegan Society's list of vegan condoms](https://www.vegansociety.com/resources/nutrition-and-health/medications/list-animal-free-medications)
- Shampoo (may contain animal lecithin)
- Toothpaste (may contain glycerine which is _usually_ not vegan unless stated)
- Razors (glycerine or lanolin may be found in the lubrication strips)
