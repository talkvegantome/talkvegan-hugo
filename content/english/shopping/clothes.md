# Clothes

Often less thought about than food, the following products on clothes will not be vegan.

- Leather (including Suede)
- Wool (Shearling, Cashmere, Angora, Merino, etc.)
- Silk
- Fur
- Feathers

## Gotchas

It's advisable to patronise vegan shoe establishments in particular as glues used in the manufacturing process for shoes made of otherwise vegan materials will make the shoes not vegan.
