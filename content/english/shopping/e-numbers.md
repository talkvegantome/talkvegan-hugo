## E120 - Carmine, Cochineal, Crimson Lake, Natural Red
A pigment produced "by boiling dried insects in water to extract the carminic acid and then treating the clear solution" ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmine)).

## E322 - Lecithin

## E422 - Glycerol, Glycerine, Glycerin
Most glycerol is derived from plant sources according to [The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/how-avoid-buying-non-vegan-products) but it's safest to check the label for an indication that it is "Suitable for vegans" or contact the manufacturer.

Check the label for vegan (or vegetarian as it is a meat product), or contact the manufacturer.
